            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><div><br></div><div>Welcome to Ratio Dating, operated by Ratio Dating, Inc. (“us,” “we,” the “Company” “Ratio Dating” or simply “Ratio”). Together you and Ratio Dating may be referred to as the “Parties” or separately as “Party.”</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><strong>1. Acceptance of Terms of Use Agreement.</strong></div><div><br></div><div>By creating a Ratio account or by using any Ratio service, whether through a mobile device, mobile application or computer (collectively, the “Service”) you agree to be bound by (i) these Terms of Use, (ii) our Privacy Policy, Safety Tips, and Community Guidelines, each of which is incorporated by reference into this Agreement, and (iii) any terms disclosed to you if you purchase or have purchased additional features, products or services we offer on the Service (collectively, this “Agreement”). If you do not accept and agree to be bound by all of the terms of this Agreement, you should not access or use the Service.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>We may make changes to this Agreement and to the Service from time to time. We may do this for a variety of reasons including to reflect changes in or requirements of the law, new features, or changes in business practices. The most recent version of this Agreement will be posted on the Service under Settings, with the most recent version being the version that applies. If the changes include material changes to your rights or obligations, we will notify you in advance of the changes (unless we’re unable to do so under applicable law) by reasonable means, which could include notification through the Service or via email. If you continue to use the Service after the changes become effective, then you agree to the revised Agreement. You agree that this Agreement shall supersede any prior agreements (except as specifically stated herein), and shall govern your entire relationship with Ratio, including but not limited to events, agreements, and conduct preceding your acceptance of this Agreement.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><strong>2. Eligibility.</strong></div><div><br></div><div>You must be at least 18 years of age to create an account on Ratio and use the Service. By creating an account and using the Service, you represent and warrant that:</div><div>you can form a binding contract with Ratio,</div><div>you are not a person who is barred from using the Service under the laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction (for example, you do not appear on the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals or face any other similar prohibition),&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">you will comply with this Agreement and all applicable local, state, national and international laws, rules and regulations, including without limitation, privacy laws, intellectual property laws, anti-spam laws, and regulatory requirements,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">you have not committed, been convicted of, or pled no contest to a felony, a sex crime, or any crime involving violence or a threat of violence, unless you have received clemency for a non-violent crime and we have determined that you are not likely to pose a threat to other users of our Service, and that you are not required to register as a sex offender with any state, federal or local sex offender registry,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">you will use the latest version of the Service (via app or website),&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">you do not have more than one account on the Service, and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">you have not previously been removed from the Service by us, unless you have our express written permission to create a new account.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">If at any time you cease to meet these requirements, all authorization to access our Service or systems is automatically revoked, and you must immediately delete your account.</span></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><strong>3. Your Account.</strong></div><div><br></div><div>In order to use Ratio, you sign up using your personal phone number and email address. For more information regarding the information we collect from you and how we use it, please consult our Privacy Policy.</div><div>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials you use to sign up for Ratio, and you are solely responsible for all activities that occur under those credentials. If you think someone has gained access to your account, please immediately contact us.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>4. Modifying the Service and Termination.</div><div>Ratio is always striving to improve the Service and bring you additional functionality that you will find engaging and useful. This means we may add new product features or enhancements from time to time as well as remove some features, and if these actions do not materially affect your rights or obligations, we may not provide you with notice before taking them. We may even suspend the Service entirely, in which event we will notify you in advance unless extenuating circumstances, such as safety or security concerns, prevent us from doing so.</div><div>You may terminate your account at any time, for any reason, by following the instructions in “Settings” in the Service.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Ratio may terminate your account at any time without notice if it believes that you have violated this Agreement. Upon such termination, you will not be entitled to any refund for purchases. After your account is terminated, this Agreement will terminate, except that the following provisions will still apply to you and Ratio: Section 4, Section 5, and Sections 12 through 19.</span></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><strong>5. Safety; Your Interactions with Other Members.</strong></div><div><br></div><div>You agree to treat other users in a courteous and respectful manner, both on and off our Services and to be respectful when communicating with any of our customer care representatives or other employees. Though Ratio strives to encourage a respectful member experience through features like the double opt-in that allows members to communicate only after they have both indicated interest in one another, Ratio is not responsible for the conduct of any member on or off of the Service. You agree to use caution in all interactions with other members, particularly if you decide to communicate off the Service or meet in person. In addition, you agree to review and follow Ratio’s Safety Tips prior to using the Service. You agree that you will not provide your financial information (for example, your credit card or bank account information), or wire or otherwise send money to other members.</div><div>You are solely responsible for your interactions with other members. You understand that ratio does not conduct criminal background checks on its members or otherwise inquire into the background of its members. Ratio makes no representations or warranties as to the conduct or compatibility of members. Ratio reserves the right to conduct – and you authorize Ratio to conduct – any criminal background check or other screenings (such as sex offender register searches) at any time using available public records obtained by it or with the assistance of a consumer reporting agency, and you agree that any information you provide may be used for that purpose.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><strong>6. Rights Ratio Grants You.</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Ratio grants you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, revocable, and non-sublicensable license to access and use the Service. This license is for the sole purpose of letting you use and enjoy the Service’s benefits as intended by Ratio and permitted by this Agreement. This license and any authorization to access the Service are automatically revoked in the event that you do any of the following:</div><div>use the Service or any content contained in the Service for any commercial purposes without our written consent:</div><div><br></div><div>copy, modify, transmit, create any derivative works from, make use of, or reproduce in any way any copyrighted material, images, trademarks, trade names, service marks, or other intellectual property, content or proprietary information accessible through the Service without Ratio’s prior written consent.</div><div>express or imply that any statements you make are endorsed by Ratio.</div><div>use any robot, bot, spider, crawler, scraper, site search/retrieval application, proxy or other manual or automatic device, method or process to access, retrieve, index, “data mine,” or in any way reproduce or circumvent the navigational structure or presentation of the Service or its contents.</div><div>use the Service in any way that could interfere with, disrupt or negatively affect the Service or the servers or networks connected to the Service.</div><div>upload viruses or other malicious code or otherwise compromise the security of the Service.</div><div>forge headers or otherwise manipulate identifiers in order to disguise the origin of any information transmitted to or through the Service.</div><div>“frame” or “mirror” any part of the Service without Ratio’s prior written authorization.</div><div>use meta tags or code or other devices containing any reference to Ratio or the Service (or any trademark, trade name, service mark, logo or slogan of Ratio) to direct any person to any other website for any purpose.</div><div>modify, adapt, sublicense, translate, sell, reverse engineer, decipher, decompile or otherwise disassemble any portion of the Service, or cause others to do so.</div><div>use or develop any third-party applications that interact with the Service or other members’ Content or information without our written consent.</div><div>use, access, or publish the Ratio application programming interface without our written consent.</div><div>probe, scan or test the vulnerability of our Service or any system or network.</div><div>encourage, promote, or agree to engage in any activity that violates this Agreement.</div><div>Ratio may investigate and take any available legal action in response to illegal and / or unauthorized uses of the Service, including termination of your account.</div><div>Any software that we provide you may automatically download and install upgrades, updates, or other new features. You may be able to adjust these automatic downloads through your device’s settings.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><strong>7. Rights you Grant Ratio.</strong></div><div><br></div><div>By creating an account, you grant to Ratio a worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, right and license to host, store, use, copy, display, reproduce, adapt, edit, publish, modify, reformat, incorporate into other works, advertise, distribute, and otherwise make available to the general public information you authorize us to access from third parties such as Facebook, Google, or Apple, as well as any information you post, upload, display or otherwise make available (collectively, “post”) on the Service or transmit to other members (collectively, “Content”). Ratio’s license to your Content shall be non-exclusive, except that Ratio’s license shall be exclusive with respect to derivative works created through use of the Service. For example, Ratio would have an exclusive license to screenshots of the Service that include your Content. In addition, so that Ratio can prevent the use of your Content outside of the Service, you authorize Ratio to act on your behalf with respect to infringing uses of your Content taken from the Service by other members or third parties. This expressly includes the authority, but not the obligation, to send notices pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3) (i.e., DMCA Takedown Notices) on your behalf if your Content is taken and used by third parties outside of the Service. Our license to your Content is subject to your rights under applicable law (for example laws regarding personal data protection to the extent any Content contains personal information as defined by those laws) and is for the limited purpose of operating, developing, providing, and improving the Service and researching and developing new ones. You agree that any Content you place or that you authorize us to place on the Service may be viewed by other members and may be viewed by any person visiting or participating in the Service (such as individuals who may receive shared Content from other Ratio members).</div><div>You agree that all information that you submit upon creation of your account, including information submitted from your Facebook account, is accurate and truthful and you have the right to post the Content on the Service and grant the license to Ratio above.</div><div>You understand and agree that we may monitor or review any Content you post as part of the Service. We may delete any Content, in whole or in part, that in our sole judgment violates this Agreement or may harm the reputation of the Service.</div><div>When communicating with our customer care representatives, you agree to be respectful and kind. If we feel that your behavior towards any of our customer care representatives or other employees is at any time threatening, harassing, or offensive, we reserve the right to immediately terminate your account.</div><div>In consideration for Ratio allowing you to use the Service, you agree that we, our affiliates, and our third-party partners may place advertising on the Service. By submitting suggestions or feedback to Ratio regarding our Service, you agree that Ratio may use and share such feedback for any purpose without compensating you.</div><div>You agree that Ratio may access, store, and disclose your account information and Content if required to do so by law, by performing its agreement with you, or in a good faith belief that such access, storage or disclosure satisfies a legitimate interest, including to: (i) comply with legal process; (ii) enforce the Agreement; (iii) respond to claims that any Content violates the rights of third parties; (iv) respond to your requests for customer service; or (v) protect the rights, property or personal safety of the Company or any other person.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><strong>8. Community Rules.</strong></div><div><br></div><div>By using the Service, you agree that you will not:</div><div>use the Service for any purpose that is illegal or prohibited by this Agreement.</div><div>use the Service for any harmful or nefarious purpose.</div><div>use the Service in order to damage Ratio.</div><div>violate our Community Guidelines, as updated from time to time.</div><div>spam or solicit money or other items of value from another member, whether as a gift, loan, or other form of compensation, or otherwise defraud any members.</div><div>impersonate any person or entity or post any images of another person without his or her permission.</div><div>bully, “stalk,” intimidate, assault, harass, mistreat or defame, or otherwise mistreat any person.</div><div>post any Content that violates or infringes anyone’s rights, including rights of publicity, privacy, copyright, trademark or other intellectual property or contract right.</div><div>post any Content that is hate speech, threatening, sexually explicit or pornographic; incites violence; or contains nudity or graphic or gratuitous violence.</div><div>post any Content that promotes racism, bigotry, hatred or physical harm of any kind against any group or individual.</div><div>solicit passwords for any purpose, or personal identifying information for commercial or unlawful purposes from other users or disseminate another person’s personal information without his or her permission.</div><div>use another user’s account, share an account with another user, or maintain more than one account.</div><div>misrepresent your identity, age, current or previous positions, qualifications, or affiliations with a person or entity.</div><div>create another account if we have already terminated your account, unless you have our permission.</div><div>Ratio reserves the right to investigate and/or terminate your account without a refund of any purchases if you have violated this Agreement, misused the Service or behaved in a way that Ratio regards as inappropriate or unlawful, including actions or communications that occur on or off the Service.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><strong>9. Other Members’ Content.</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Although Ratio reserves the right to review and remove Content that violates this Agreement, such Content is the sole responsibility of the member who posts it, and Ratio cannot guarantee that all Content will comply with this Agreement. If you see Content on the Service that violates this Agreement, please report it within the Service or via our contact emails.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><strong>10. Disclaimers.</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Ratio provides the service on an “as is” and “as available” basis and to the extent permitted by applicable law, grants no warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise with respect to the service (including all content contained therein), including, without limitation, any implied warranties of satisfactory quality, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or non-infringement. Ratio does not represent or warrant that (a) the service will be uninterrupted, secure or error free, (b) any defects or errors in the service will be discovered or corrected, or (c) that any content or information you obtain on or through the service will be accurate, or appropriate for your purposes.</div><div>Ratio assumes no responsibility for any content that you or another member or third party posts, sends or receives through the service. Any material downloaded or otherwise obtained through the use of the service is accessed at your own discretion and risk.</div><div>Ratio disclaims and assumes no responsibility for any conduct of you or any other member, on or off the service.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><strong>11. Third Party Services.</strong></div><div><br></div><div>The Service may contain advertisements and promotions offered by third parties and links to other web sites or resources. Ratio is not responsible for the availability (or lack of availability) of such external websites or resources. If you choose to interact with the third parties made available through our Service, such party’s terms will govern their relationship with you. Ratio is not responsible or liable for such third parties’ terms or actions.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><strong>12. Indemnity by You.</strong></div><div><br></div><div>You agree, to the extent permitted under applicable law, to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Ratio, our affiliates, and their and our respective officers, directors, agents, and employees from and against any and all complaints, demands, claims, damages, losses, costs, liabilities and expenses, including attorney’s fees, due to, arising out of, or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Service, your Content, or your breach of this Agreement.</div><div><br></div></div>
